# vim-vue-config

This is my local vim/nvim config using lua for vue projects. Derived from https://github.com/vncsmyrnk/vim-config.git 

To work properly this repo should be cloned on `~/.config/nvim` and [packer.vim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) must be installed.

To install it just run:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/vncsmyrnk/vim-vue-config.git ~/.config/nvim
```

Next, opem `nvim` and be sure to run `PackerSync` to install the dependencies. Errors may occur when running `PackerSync`, so be sure to run it multiple times if necessary.

\**Note that the last command will override any existing nvim config*
